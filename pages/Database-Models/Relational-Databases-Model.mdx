# Relational Databases Model

![RDBMS Title](/RDBMS_1.png)

A relational database is a collection of information that stores data in the form of rows and columns [i.e. a table]. It consists of a unique identifier [i.e. a primary key] that is used to identify data within a specific table with ease. It is one of the most used database model nowadays as it is easy to understand and implement.

## Schema

The schema of RDBMS consists of tables, each consisting of their specific unique identifiers and names of columns etc.

### Example

Student_data(student_name, student_roll_no, student_cgpa).

Here the student_data is the entity and the names within the brackets are the attributes.

## When to use

When the relationship between the data elements is clearly defined [structured data], RDBMS is the best model to be used.

## Advantages

Easy to understand, implement and use. Supports a vast range of applications like inventory management, financial systems etc.

## Disadvantages

Situation is complicated when dealing with complex queries. Not suitable for unstructured data.
